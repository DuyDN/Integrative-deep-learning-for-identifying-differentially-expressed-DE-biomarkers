# Integrative-deep-learning-for-identifying-differentially-expressed-DE-biomarkers
## Description
This package is aim to find biomarkers via integrative deep learning. We propose adding an integrated layer to the deep learning structure, which would enable the effective analysis of genetic data as well as the discovery of significant biomarkers of disease. "INTEGRATED_GANN" is main fucntion where we train datasets and test the performance of trained model.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
